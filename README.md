# hackathon_CSA_app
This application was a part of the 24-hour FrontEd Hackathon @ Span 2023 competition. Application won 1st place. The main features of an app were real-time monitoring and identifying threats on a local network. We simulated real-time monitoring with hard-coded data to make our demonstration easier. We deployed the backend using Azure and for frontend deployment, we used Heroku. After the competition results were announced, we removed our deployments from the public servers. My personal contribution is reflected in the deployment, some parts of the backend and the demonstration.
